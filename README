Bones 
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme

_______________________________________________________________
HEADS UP!!!
Bones & Bones (Responsive Edition) are going to be merged into one repo 
any day now. Since the responsive version seems to be the way to go, 
that version is going to take precedence. If you like the Classic
Version of Bones, I suggest forking it and keeping your very own
version!
_______________________________________________________________

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
There are also a ton of bonus features such as page navi, breadcrumbs,
related posts, and html5 video with fallback. It's constantly growing
so be sure to check back often if you are a frequent user.
