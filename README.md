iRaghu-Fixed-Navbar-Theme
=========================

This is the current theme I have been using on my personal website and blog http://www.iraghu.com
The theme is based on Bones, a WordPress theme made by Eddie Machado.

Fixed Navigation Bar

It contains a fixed horizontal navigation bar with the logo, and the page elements. and a dedicated homepage to write about yourself, add an
image, and show the categories of posts you write and your Recent Posts. 
I haven't changed the default name of the page though. Its posts-custom.php. Its upto you if you want to change it.

Fonts

I have embedded a cuple of fonts like Open Sans, Ubuntu etc. in the fonts folder.
